title: 'kfa/sloev - markov fimbul performance at galore festival'
---

KFA wrote a ton a of poems about the silver fox and read them out loud while three things happened:

1. record players played metal scraps connected to the pickup with elastic bands
2. his voice was processed and amplified by a Pure Data patch (as heard in the video)
3. a computer generated new poems, using markov chains, using his poems as input and projected them on the opposite wall.

software for the markov chain poem generator/projector can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/johannes.valbjorn/markovfimbulgenerator2013)
